## Welcome to my first post!

This is the main body of my blog post. It's written in **Markdown**, which is a simple way to format text.

- You can create lists.
- You can make text **bold** or *italic*.
- You can even add links, like to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/).

It's a very clean and simple way to write content.
